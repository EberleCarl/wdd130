        <p>Hello. My name is Carl Eberle. 
            I am from Olivehurst CA.
            I am the oldest of four kids in a family of six.
            I enjoy playing games with family and friends,
             as well as going trap shooting or skeet shooting with shotguns.
             My favorite foods are Ramen, Sushi, Little Ceasars Pizza, and Steak.</p>

        <h2> California, USA</h2>

        <p>California is a state that has given many people strong, mixed feelings.
            A lot of people dislike the state because of its economics or politics, but those who live there know a different side.
            Aside from all the politics, the ammount of national parks and wildlife in California is very pretty in my eyes.
            It allows for spots to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city to the quite and peaceful side of nature.</p>
